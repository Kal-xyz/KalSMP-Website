<Aside>Files that are not included in the modpack may sometimes be deleted when updating the modpack!</Aside>

If you want to add other mods, resource packs or shader packs that are not in the modpack, 
can you do so by downloading them from their website or installing them through your launcher.

## How to install additional mods, resource packs or shader packs

From the website that you are downloading the file, it should most likely save in your downloads folder,
from there, you can copy it to the `.minecraft\mods|resourcepacks|shaderpacks` folder(s), where all the other files should be.
If you are on Windows, this folder is usually located in your `%appdata%` folder. (unless you manually
altered the location). Below you can see where your .minecraft folder is located for your launcher:

import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { Icon } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
