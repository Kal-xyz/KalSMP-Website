# Introduction
You may have already logged into the game, opened the quest menu and thought to yourself:
"what in gods name have i gotten myself into"
This guide will serve as an introdudction/helping hand to play on our server for when the quests are just too hard to figure out.
We will try and keep this as updated as posible, and hope this will be of help to both players new and old to modding.
