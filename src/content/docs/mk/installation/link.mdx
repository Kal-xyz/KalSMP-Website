title: Linking & Whitelist
description: Verify your Minecraft Account with your Discord Account
---

In order to keep random people from joining our server, there is a linking system in place so that
nobody outside the discord server is able to join.

- To link your Minecraft Account with your Discord Account, you first need to join the SMP to receive the secret code.
It should look something like this:

<img src="../../../src/assets/link-code.webp"></img>

- Once you tried joining once, go to the discord server in any channel and type ```/link yourcode```.
It should look something like this:

<img src="../../../src/assets/link-command.webp"></img>
<img src="../../../src/assets/link-success.webp"></img>

## Additional Information

- You have completed the set-up process, have fun playing on the SMP!

- If you have any issues with the modpack, check out the [Troubleshoot](https://kalxyz.com/extras/troubleshoot) tab below to see if you can find a
fix there, otherwise you can reach out to support in the Discord Server.
