as well as if the game has sufficient amount of memory allocated.

### Connection Reset Error

- This error can occur due to multiple reasons, sometimes it might even be due to the server, the most common
fixes you can try is to restart your game, reconnted to your network or flush your dns. If you have the Krypton
Mod installed that can sometimes cause issues as well.

### Constant Crashes (CurseForge)

- If you are running the default settings on the Minecraft Launcher, you can try to increase the RAM by going to
**Installations** at the top click on the 3 dots that appear on the right, then Edit. Once at this screen, expand
the **MORE OPTIONS** dropdown and change the JVM ARGUMENTS `-Xmx` and `-Xms` values (`-Xmx` stands for maximum &
`-Xms` stands for minimum). Depending on the amount of RAM on your system, you can change this value to a higher number.
(For example 8G or 16G (*G stands for gigabytes*)). This will increase performance drastically.
